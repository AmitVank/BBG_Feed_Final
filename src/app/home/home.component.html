  <p class='indented'>In today’s world data is considered as NEW oil, which comes from a myriad of different sources
    such as transaction
    systems, customer data, financial data, stock market data, various news channels, mobile application, IOT. Data is
    growing at an astronomical rate, companies, Individuals use data science, analytics and machine learning to name a
    few to sift through the goldmine of data to derive meaning full strategies. The outcome of mining the data using
    different science can anticipate and predict customer behavior, market trends to name a few patterns.</p>

  <p class='indented'>My project involves analyzing the stock prices to find crucial data points such as outliers. Outlier basically
    observes unusual patterns on the stock performance by using timeseries model. Time series models stocks prices
    correctly which helps the stock buyer decide when to buy or sell stocks. Time series looks at sequence of historical
    data to predict the future prices and behaviors. To accomplish this, I have built this website 
    and the following tasks were performed.</p>

  <p class='indented'>Step 1: Angular CLI, Node.js, Git CLI and visual studio were downloaded and the environment was set up to build the
    website.
    <br>
    Step 2: The next important step was to identify the market data to analyze stock performance. Based on my research,
    I was able to identify free API from marketstack.com. Market stack API provided historical data stock prices from
    various exchanges around the world.
    <br>
    Step 3: Used Angular to build the front end webpage which calls the Marketstack using rest API
    <br>
    Step 4: The market data from the API was fed to Time series model
    <br>
    Step 5: Timeseries model analysis is done using the following Python packages and R in Jupyter notebook. The output
    of the timeseries model was displayed on the website

  <ul class='indented'>
    <li>plotly - Used for interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks</li>
    <li>NumPy - Used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to
      Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of
      high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.</li>
    <li>Pandas - Used to convert Numpy array to a Pandas data frame.</li>
    <li> datetime - Used to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates,
      times
      and time intervals. Date and datetime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are actually
      manipulating objects and not string or timestamps.</li>
  </ul> 



  <p class='indented'>Step 6: The website was hosted in Amazon web services using S3 bucket.</p>
  
  <h3 class='indented'>What is Next? Journey Continues….</h3>
  <p class='indented'>
    Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model to Predict Stock Prices and compare with various other predicting techniques
    such as moving averages, linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, ARIMA and Prophet
